# DHCP setup

## Create a configuration node
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name>

## Sometimes commands in VyOS configuration mode get fairly long.
## Edit command can be used to set CLI context to the desired node.
edit service dhcp-server shared-network-name <name>

## Set dhcp server as authoritative. Authoritative option allows DHCP server
## to send a DHCPNAK messages for a mis-configured clients.
set authoritative enable

## Configure guest subnet and its pool
set subnet 192.168.0.0/24 start 192.168.0.10 stop 192.168.0.250

## Configure default gateway for DHCP clients:
set subnet 192.168.0.0/24 default-router 192.168.0.254

## Configure DNS server for DHCP clients:
set subnet 192.168.0.0/24 dns-server 192.168.0.254

## Set DHCP lease
## DHCP server lease is specified in seconds, by default 86400.
set subnet 192.168.0.0/24 lease 43200

## Configure domain name
set subnet 192.168.0.0/24 domain-name <name>
set subnet 192.168.0.0/24 domain-search <name>

## Use the exit command in order to leave from the edit CLI context
exit

# DNS

## Specify a name server where to forward DNS requests
set service dns forwarding name-server 8.8.8.8

## Configure interface to listen for DNS
set service dns forwarding listen-on eth1

## Set a static mapping for hostname to IP
set system static-host-mapping host-name <name> inet 192.168.0.2


# SNAT

## In VyOS firewall and NAT is configured as a series of rules.
## Each rule performs an action which it is specified to do.
## Rules are numbered and are evaluated in numerical order.

## Create and start editing nat rule
edit nat source rule 10

## Add description
set description "server subnet SNAT"

## Set source address
set source address 192.168.0.0/24

## Set translation address
set translation address <IP>


## Set the interface that is connected to outside world
set outbound-interface eth0

## Check nat translations
run show nat source translations


# DNAT (port forwarding)

## Create and start editing nat rule
edit nat destination rule 10

## Add description
set description "Webserver HTTP"

## Set destination address
set destination address 30.0.127.3

## Set port
set destination port 80

## Set protocol
set protocol tcp

## Set translation address
set translation address 192.168.88.200

## Set interface that you want this rule apply to
set inbound-interface any

## Show dnat translations
run show nat destination translations


# Firewall

## There are two ways for configuring packet inspection in VyOS:
## Declaring globally in firewall state policy;
## Specifying packet inspection on every firewall rule-set
## Below you will see how to configure packet state policy globally.

## Globally allow all packets
set firewall state-policy established action accept

## allow packets which are starting a new connection
set firewall state-policy related action accept

## Deny invalid packets
set firewall state-policy invalid action drop

## Bind interfaces with specific zone
set zone-policy zone WAN interface eth0

## Configure a local zone (you will loose connection to router here)
zeus@vyos# set zone-policy zone LOCAL local-zone

## A rule-set is a named collection of firewall rules
## that can be applied to an interface or zone.
## Rules are numbered and are evaluated in numerical order.

## Create and start editing rule
edit firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 10

## Set description
set description "Allow SSH from 30.0.127.0/28"

## Set a criteria on how to filter trafic
set action accept

## Set a destination address
set destination address 30.0.127.0/28

## Set protocol
set protocol tcp

## Set port
set destination port 28960

## Set a rule to filter trafic from WAN to LOCAL
set zone-policy zone LOCAL from WAN firewall name WAN-LOCAL
